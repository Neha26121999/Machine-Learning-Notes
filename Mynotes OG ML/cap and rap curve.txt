The ramifications of a false positive would at first be heartbreaking for the patient; to have to deal with the trauma of facing this news and telling your family and friends is not a situation you would wish upon anyone, but after going for treatment, the doctors will find out that she does not have the virus. Again, this would not be a particularly pleasant experience. But not having HIV is ultimately a good thing.
On the other hand, a false negative would mean that the patient has HIV but the test shows a negative result. The implications of this are terrifying, the patient would be missing out on crucial treatments and runs a high risk of spreading the virus to others
Without much doubt, the false negative here is the bigger problem. Both for the person and for society.
