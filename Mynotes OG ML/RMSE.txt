Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.
Based on a rule of thumb, it can be said that RMSE values between 0.2 and 0.5 shows that the model can relatively predict the data accurately. In addition, Adjusted R-squared more than 0.75 is a very good value for showing the accuracy. In some cases, Adjusted R-squared of 0.4 or more is acceptable as well.
