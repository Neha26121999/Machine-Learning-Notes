           Regression
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. ... Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).
why:we will use regression when we want to predict only number values.
 

why we called it Linear Regression:
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.
example: age
1.dependent 
2.independent
ex:  y=mx+c
Real Life Example:
  Salary vs Experiance
   Salary=m(Experiance)+ c

1)Cost Function (J):
By achieving the best-fit regression line, the model aims to predict y value such that the error difference between predicted value and true value is minimum. So, it is very important to update the θ1 and θ2 values, to reach the best value that minimize the error between predicted y value (pred) and true y value (y).

                              
                         cost Function(J)=(predicted value-true value)^2


Cost function(J) of Linear Regression is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between predicted y value (pred) and true y value (y).

2)Gradient Descent:
      y=θ1+θ2x
θ1: intercept
θ2: coefficient of x
To update θ1 and θ2 values in order to reduce Cost function (minimizing RMSE value) and achieving the best fit line the model uses Gradient Descent. The idea is to start with random θ1 and θ2 values and then iteratively updating the values, reaching minimum cost.
