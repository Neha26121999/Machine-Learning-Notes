Hypothesis:
  a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis. A hypothesis is something more than a wild guess but less than a well-established theory.(it is a claim)

There are two types of hypothesis:
1)Null Hypothesis: 
                 if p value>0.5(accept null) it is statistically insignificant.means it have nothing to prove.and the results we have obtain could be explain by random variance...p_value<0.5 (reject null)
what is p Value:
         the probability of seeing the effect(E) when the null hypothesis is true.P value is a statistical measure that helps scientists determine whether or not their hypotheses are correc
But how low is ‘low enough’ for rejecting the null hypothesis?
This level of ‘low enough’ cutoff is called the alpha level, and you need to decide it before conducting a statistical test.en the p-value is low enough, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude the observed effect holds.
2)Alpha Level:
   It is the cutoff probability for p-value to establish statistical significance for a given hypothesis test.
For an observed effect to be considered as statistically significant, the p-value of the test should be lower than the pre-decided alpha value.

Typically for most statistical tests(but not always), alpha is set as 0.05.

2)Alternative Hypothesis (H1, read “H one”): states the opposite of the Null Hypothesis. That there was some change, or observed relationship between what you are comparing
